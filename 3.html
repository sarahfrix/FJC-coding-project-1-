          <h2> Frix Jennings Clinic History and Establishment </h2> 
          <h3> Frix Jennings Clinic was establised in 2001 in Henderson Tennessee. This was the first branch of this soon to be West Tennessee wide practice. Dr. Carey Frix and Nicole Jennings have built the fist family clinic practice in Henderson. This location was located in downtown Henderson. For many years, FJC stayed only local to henderson for about a long period of time before deciding that branching the family buisness would do well for the practice. Frix Jennings Clinic then expanded to other small towns to provide their services. In 2006, Frix Jennings Clinic established it's Bolivar Location. The Bolivar location was built bigger with a more modernistic style. Carey Frix purchased the property strip of land where the Bolivar Clinic was establised allowing for a partnership between the clinic and a physical therapy center next door. A year later, FJC expanded to Selmer, Tennessee. For a couple years, the practice buisness stayed steady, in 2011 however, Dr. Frix and Nicole Jennings decided that in order for the clinic to excell in buisness, branching out to a larger environment was necessary. In 2011, the Frix Jennings Clinic in Downtown Memphis was established allowing for new family practice care to be provided in the busy city. The practices most recent additions inclue our locations in Parsons and Jackson Tennessee.   <br>
